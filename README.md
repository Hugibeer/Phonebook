# Phonebook
=========

## Application for job at Omega-Software

This is my first "serious" project made using ASP.NET MVC, Web API and a Javascript. 
it is a simple phonebook application. User comes in to an application, registers for an account and gets to use 
this service. Currently, the things are set up so that the user gets some sample contacts at the beginning, just so 
I can demonstrate what the app can do. 

Client side is written using Javascript almost exclusively. This is just the first version of the app which doesn't 
use any of the gooddies that some JavaScript frameworks provide, like Backbone, Knockout or Angular. In further releases
this can change, if it ever becomes necessary, or I just decide to showcase some of my newly obtained skills.

Preffered web browsers for using the app are Opera 18, Mozilla firefox, Google Chrome and Safari, while currently it 
doesn't work with Internet Explorer 11, and earlier releases of Opera. There are some issues regarding back cacheing 
that occur because of the way the app is written currently. When I get around of learning the ways of fixing this issue, 
the application will be updated.
